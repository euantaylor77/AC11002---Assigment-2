    <h3><b>Employment History</b></h3>
    <h4>Tesco Linwood</h4>
    <p> I was a grocery team memeber from May 2018 Onwards. This job involved filling the shelves in all the grocery aisle. This could range from juices to canned veg and cereal. I really enjoy the work and love working with the public and local
      community.</p>
    <p>Before i was part of the grocery team I was a customer assistant (checkouts). This was from Nov 2017 to May 2018. My role was to greet and serve customers at the checkouts and be on hand for any questions or queries they might have. I enjoyed
      this as you got to meet and speak with alot of interesting people and this really increased my speaking confidence.</p>
    <h4>Footasylum Braehead</h4>
    <p>I was a customer assistant in the Braehead store from Aug 2017 to Nov 2017. This job was good as it was in a store which I reguarly visited myself meaning I had alot of knowledge on alot of the products we sold. This job only lasted a few
      weeks as I was offered a job closer to home and my manager at the time was happy to let me leave for a more local job.</p>
