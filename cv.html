    <h3>Employment History</h3>
    <h3>Tesco Linwood</h3>

My role was to greet and serve cusomers at the checkouts and be on nhand for any questions or queries they might have. I enjoyed this as you got to meet and speak with alot of interesting people and this really increased my speaking confidence.</p>
    <h3>Footasylum Braehead</h3>
    <p>I was a customer assistant in the Braehead store from Aug 2017 to Nov 2017. This job was good as it was in a store which I reguarly visited myself meaning I had alot of knowledge on alot of the product we sold. This job only lasted a few weeks as I was offered a job closer to home and my managercat the time was happy to let me leave for a more local job.</p>
